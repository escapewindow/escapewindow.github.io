title: configman py3 support
---

Back in 2015 I tried porting <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/configman">configman</a> to python 3, but then I hit a wall with the <code>DotDict __getattr__</code> hack.  I wrote about that <a href="http://escapewindow.dreamwidth.org/246718.html">here</a>.<br /><br />For some reason I took another stab at it last week, after leveling up my python3 porting skills.  I got the tests green, submitted a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/configman/pull/163">PR</a>, which is now merged and <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/configman">released</a>.  Woot!
