Fur seal rescue in Hercules Bay, South Georgia
<p>
We took a zodiac ride around Hercules Bay on what was to be our final morning in South Georgia.  <a href="http://www.photoguth.com/">Eric</a>, our zodiac driver, heard chatter on the radio about a fur seal caught in a packing strap, so we went over to check it out.

We found him<small>?</small> sitting on the rocks, a loop around his neck.

He was cute.

We took some photos, then wandered off to watch the macaroni penguins for a bit.  When we heard they were about to free him, we hurried over, cameras in hand.

Our expedition leader, <a href="http://www.expeditions.com/why-us/expedition-team/staff-bios/lisa-kelley/">Lisa Kelley</a>, caught the fur seal in a net, so they could remove the packaging material.

Letting him go.

Afterwards, I noticed he still had a crease around his neck, but he was free of the loop.  Later that evening we saw pictures of animals that grew to full size after swimming through a loop of some sort: some are visible <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=fur%20seal%20plastic%20trash">here</a>.
