title: 'python package pinning: pip-tools and dephash'
---

<h4>
discovering pip tools
</h4><p>
Last week, I wrote a long blog draft about python package pinning.  Then I found <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/pin-your-packages/">this</a>.  It's well written, and covers many of the points I wanted to make.  The author perfectly summarizes the divide between package <i>development</i> and package <i>deployment to production</i>:
</p><center><table border="0" cellpadding="5" style="background-color: #dddddd"><tr><td><center>
Don't pin by default when you're building libraries! Only use pinning for end products.</center></td></tr></table></center><p>
So I dug deeper.  <a href="https://github.com/nvie/pip-tools/issues/303"><code>pip-tools #303</code></a> perfectly describes the problem I was trying to solve:
</p><blockquote>Given a minimal dependency list,
<ol><li>generate a full, expanded dependency list, and</li>
<li>pin that full dependency list by version and hash.</li></ol></blockquote><p>
Fixing <code>pip-tools #303</code> and upstreaming seemed like the ideal solution.
</p><p>
<strike>However, <a href="https://github.com/nvie/pip-tools/issues/358">pip-tools is broken with pip 8.1.2</a>.</strike>  The Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) states that <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3687#issuecomment-219299825">pip's public API is the CLI</a>, and <code>pip-tools</code> could <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3687#issuecomment-219297966">potentially break with every new pip patch release</a>.  This is solvable by either <a href="https://github.com/nvie/pip-tools/issues/358#issuecomment-219984145">using pypa/packaging directly</a>, or switching <code>pip-tools</code> to use the CLI.  That's considerably more work than just integrating hashing capability into <code>pip-tools</code>.  (<b>[EDIT]</b> pip-tools now works with pip 8.1.2, but shoehorning hashes into it is a non-trivial task.  I do hope someone tackles it though.) 
</p><p>
But I had already whipped up a quick'n'dirty python script that used the pip CLI.  (I had assumed that bypassing the internal API was a hack, but evidently this is the supported way of doing things.)  So, back to the original blog post, but much shorter:
</p><h4>
<a name="dephash_gen">dephash gen</a>
</h4><p>
<code>dephash gen</code> takes a minimal requirements file, and generates an expanded dependency list, pinned by version and hash.
</p><blockquote><pre>

Developers can work against <code>requirements-dev.txt</code>, with the latest available dependencies.  At the same time, production can be pinned against specific package versions+hashes for stability and security.
</p><h4>
<a name="dephash_outdated">dephash outdated</a>
</h4><p>
<code>dephash outdated PATH</code> checks whether <code>PATH</code> contains outdated packages.  <code>PATH</code> can be a requirements file or virtualenv.
</p><blockquote><pre>
$ cat requirements-outdated.txt

six==1.9.0

$ dephash outdated requirements-outdated.txt

Found outdated packages in requirements-outdated.txt:
six (1.9.0) - Latest: 1.10.0 [wheel]
</pre></blockquote><p>
or,
</p><blockquote><pre>
$ virtualenv -q venv

$ venv/bin/pip install -q -r requirements-outdated.txt

$ dephash outdated venv

Found outdated packages in venv:
six (1.9.0) - Latest: 1.10.0 [wheel]
</pre></blockquote><p>
This just uses <code>pip list --outdated</code> on the backend.  I'm tentatively thinking a whitelist of known-outdated dependencies might help here, but I haven't written it yet.
</p><h4>
wrapup
</h4><p>
I still think the glorious future involves fixing <a href="https://github.com/nvie/pip-tools/issues/303">pip-tools #303</a> and getting <code>pip-tools</code> pointed at a supported pypa API.  And/or getting <code>hashin</code> or <code>pip-tools</code> upstreamed into <code>pip</code>.  But in the meantime, there's <a href="https://github.com/escapewindow/dephash"><code>dephash</code></a>.
